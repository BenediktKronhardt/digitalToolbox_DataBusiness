# Theoretical background

## Cost of Living Index

To be able to compare the cost of living between different countries, the Cost of Living Index (CLI) is used. The cost of living is the financial resources needed to cover, in a given place and in a given period of time, the basic expenses for a given standard of living, such as a shelter, food, medicines and others. The CLI enables the comparison of expenditures between different places in the world and at different times in history.[@caroline]

In economics, the cost-of-living index describes the ratio of the minimum expenditure required to achieve a given indifference curve between two prices. The calculation not only requires two different price groups, but is also dependent on a preference order of the required living goods and on a basic indifference curve describing the utility of two products. 
Among the two prices needed, e.g., from two different places, one is called the comparison price and the other is called the reference price or the base price. The base price is then used to illustrate on which prices the Cost-Of-Living Index is based and calculated. The calculated index is then dependent on the comparison prices determined. Further, the general logic of the cost-of-living index is best understood when the index is interpreted in the multiple context of temporal and spatial comparisons.[@Pollak1989]

## Industrialized, emerging and developing countries

In general, countries are divided into industrialized, emerging and developing countries. States in which the economic performance is supported by a large part of the resident companies are referred to as industrialized countries. Such countries stand out due to their high per capita income, which results from the available standard of education, high productivity in production, good external trade relations and usually a currency with low inflation.^[@bpd]


A country that is in the process of becoming an industrialized country is called an emerging country. These are nevertheless referred to the category of developing countries. Emerging countries are identifiable by their above-average economic growth. Nevertheless, emerging countries are similar to developing countries in the social structure, such as in the level of education, mortality and access to infrastructure.[@bmz]

The third category is developing countries, which are associated with poor food supply, high poverty, poor health care and educational opportunities. In association with the characteristics, such countries have an overall low standard of living and a preponderance of labor in agriculture and external economic difficulties.[@bmzentwicklung]

To analyze the available data, developing were combined with emerging countries and contrasted with developed countries.
