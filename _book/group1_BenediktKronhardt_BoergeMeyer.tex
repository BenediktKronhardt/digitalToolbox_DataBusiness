\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The standard of living became more important for the world population. But every standard of living comes at a price. How high the standard of living is in a country can be analyzed and compared between countries with the help of the cost of living index.

\hypertarget{task-description}{%
\section{Task description}\label{task-description}}

The objective was to analyze a data set and write a report about it using R, RStudio, RMarkdown and the procedures of literate programming to put together a PDF-manuscript.
For this paper, a ``cost of living'' data set was received and analyzed in order to determine whether the classification as a developing or industrialized country has a significant impact on the Cost of Living Index.

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\section{Structure}\label{structure}}

The document is divided into five chapters. In the following, this chapter explains how the data was processed. The introduction is followed by an explanation of the Cost of Living Index and categorization as developed, emerging and developing countries, before in the methods section the data set is statistically described, including information on the variables' distribution, missing values,
categories and the relationships between the variables.
The results section comprise all necessary calculations, which are then discussed in connection with the research question in the following section.

\hypertarget{setup}{%
\section{Setup}\label{setup}}

Subsequently, the data had to be read in.

To make it easier to split the data by region, a data set was imported that shows the names of the countries in this world and their corresponding regions.
This data set was received from the website ``kaggle'', named ``Country Mapping - ISO, Continent, Region''. \footnote{Kaggle, \protect\hyperlink{ref-continents2}{{``Country Mapping - ISO, Continent, Region,''} December 2019, \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/country-mapping-iso-continent-region}}.}

To be able to do a join with the raw data, the column ``name'' had to be renamed to ``country''. After that, a left join could be performed on the renamed column.

Now it was possible to check if a country was not assigned to a region.
Since the country Kosovo could not be assigned to a region, this had to be done manually.

To assign the different countries in the data set to either a developing or an industrialized country, another data set was imported.
We created this file ourselves, based on data from UN\footnote{\protect\hyperlink{ref-ddcountries}{\emph{World Economic Situation and Prospects} (United Nations, 2014)}.}.

Once this was done,the data set has been scanned for various capitalization errors and corrected. Also the column Category has been renamed to Development.

As a result, it was possible to perform a left join and add the categorization of the countries to the provided data set.

\hypertarget{cost-of-living-index}{%
\section{Cost of Living Index}\label{cost-of-living-index}}

To be able to compare the cost of living between different countries, the Cost of Living Index (CLI) is used. The cost of living is the financial resources needed to cover, in a given place and in a given period of time, the basic expenses for a given standard of living, such as a shelter, food, medicines and others. The CLI enables the comparison of expenditures between different places in the world and at different times in history.\footnote{\protect\hyperlink{ref-caroline}{Caroline Banton, {``Cost of Living: Definition, How to Calculate, Index, and Example,''} March 2021, \url{https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-of-living.asp}}.}

In economics, the cost-of-living index describes the ratio of the minimum expenditure required to achieve a given indifference curve between two prices. The calculation not only requires two different price groups, but is also dependent on a preference order of the required living goods and on a basic indifference curve describing the utility of two products.
Among the two prices needed, e.g., from two different places, one is called the comparison price and the other is called the reference price or the base price. The base price is then used to illustrate on which prices the Cost-Of-Living Index is based and calculated. The calculated index is then dependent on the comparison prices determined. Further, the general logic of the cost-of-living index is best understood when the index is interpreted in the multiple context of temporal and spatial comparisons.\footnote{\protect\hyperlink{ref-Pollak1989}{Robert A. Pollak, \emph{The Theory of the Cost-of-Living Index} (Oxford University Press, 1989)}.}

\hypertarget{industrialized-emerging-and-developing-countries}{%
\section{Industrialized, emerging and developing countries}\label{industrialized-emerging-and-developing-countries}}

In general, countries are divided into industrialized, emerging and developing countries. States in which the economic performance is supported by a large part of the resident companies are referred to as industrialized countries. Such countries stand out due to their high per capita income, which results from the available standard of education, high productivity in production, good external trade relations and usually a currency with low inflation.\footnote{BPB, \protect\hyperlink{ref-bpd}{{``Industrieländer''} (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, June 2021), \url{https://www.bpb.de/kurz-knapp/lexika/lexikon-der-wirtschaft/19720/industrielaender/}}.}

A country that is in the process of becoming an industrialized country is called an emerging country. These are nevertheless referred to the category of developing countries. Emerging countries are identifiable by their above-average economic growth. Nevertheless, emerging countries are similar to developing countries in the social structure, such as in the level of education, mortality and access to infrastructure.\footnote{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bmz}{BMZ, {``Schwellenland''} (Bundesamt für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, n.d.), \url{https://www.bmz.de/de/service/lexikon/schwellenland-14810}}.}

The third category is developing countries, which are associated with poor food supply, high poverty, poor health care and educational opportunities. In association with the characteristics, such countries have an overall low standard of living and a preponderance of labor in agriculture and external economic difficulties.\footnote{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bmzentwicklung}{BMZ, {``Entwicklungsland''} (Bundesamt für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, n.d.), \url{https://www.bmz.de/de/service/lexikon/entwicklungsland-14308}}.}

To analyze the available data, developing were combined with emerging countries and contrasted with developed countries.

\hypertarget{data-description}{%
\section{Data Description}\label{data-description}}

The provided data consists of \(511\) different data sets from \(110\) different states. The data was set up into City, State, Country, Cost of Living Plus Rent Index, CLI, Rent Index, Groceries Index, Restaurant Index, Local Purchasing Power Index, Leverage Model 1 and Leverage Model 2 attributes.

In Figure \ref{fig:continentCountdata} can be seen how many data sets are available per region.

\caption{Count of Data from different regions}\label{fig:continentCountdata}
\end{figure}

In addition to the overview of data sets by region in figure \ref{fig:continentCountdata}, a world map in figure \ref{fig:worldMap} has been created to illustrate the countries from which the data sets originate. The data sets from the industrialized countries were marked in blue and those from the emerging and developing countries in red.

\begin{figure}[H]

\hypertarget{exploratory-data-analysis}{%
\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

First it had to be checked whether there are missing values inside of the data set.

There were \(383\) missing values inside the column ``state''.
However, since the column has no bearing on the research question, it was decided to disregard this column. With the city column there are a more meaningful basis to answer the question.
To disregard this column, it was cut off.

Also the leverage\_model\_1 and leverage\_model\_2 columns were cut off, since it was not work with these columns any further.

To determine if outliers exist within the data set, a boxplot was drawn.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{group1_BenediktKronhardt_BoergeMeyer_files/figure-latex/boxplot-1} 

}

\caption{Boxplot of Data to identify outliers}\label{fig:boxplot}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from the figure \ref{fig:boxplot}, there are several outliers within the data set. In order not to distort the result, it was decided to keep these outliers and to continue working with them.

\clearpage

\hypertarget{results}{%
\chapter{Results - Multiple linear regression}\label{results}}

To determine if there was a significant difference between developing and developed countries, multiple linear regression was performed. The purpose is to determine whether or not classification as a developing country has a significant impact on the cost of living index.

Within multiple linear regression, the dependent variable (y) is the cost of living index. The independent variables (x) are the rent index, the groceries index, the restaurant price index, the local purchasing power index as well as the development status.

In order to perform a multiple linear regression, some conditions have to be fulfilled, which we will check in the following.

First, there must be a linear relationship between the x variables and the y variable. Also, the y variable must be metrically scaled, which is given.

Third, the residuals should be approximately normally distributed. We proved this graphically with the help of a histogram.

First, we need to set up our model as in equation \eqref{eq:lm1}.

\begin{align} 
  CLI_{\text{\,i}} &= \upalpha + \upbeta_{1} \times Rent~Index_{\text{\,i}} + \upbeta_{2} \times Groceries~Index_{\text{\,i}} + \upbeta_{3} \times Restaurant~Price~Index_{\text{\,i}} + &&\notag\\
  \phantom{CLI_{\text{\,i}}} & \phantom{{} =  ^l} \upbeta_{4} \times Local~Purchasing~Power~Index_{\text{\,i}} +  \upbeta_{5} \times Development_{\text{\,i}} + \upepsilon_{\text{\,i}} &&\notag\\
\upepsilon_{i} &\sim N(0, \upsigma^{2})
  \label{eq:lm1}
\end{align}

After that, a histogram can be created, see figure \ref{fig:histogramModel}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{group1_BenediktKronhardt_BoergeMeyer_files/figure-latex/histogramModel-1} 

}

\caption{Histogram of the residuals from the multiple linear regression model}\label{fig:histogramModel}
\end{figure}

The histogram visualizes a distribution can be considered normally distributed, therefore this condition is also fulfilled. Scaling is also given, since the cost of living index is on a scale.

The last checked condition is that there is no multicollinearity within the independent variables. To verify this, we created a correlation matrix. First, a subset from the data was generated in which the variables to be tested are stored. Then we created the correlation matrix from this subset and worked with the pearson method.

Since the correlation between restaurant price index and groceries index is \(0.85\) \textgreater{} 0.8, this may indicate that there is multicollinearity. To confirm this, an another method was utilized to test for multicollinearity, the method of Variance Inflation Factor values.

\clearpage

\begin{verbatim}
#>                   rent_index              groceries_index 
#>                     2.821033                     4.346802 
#>       restaurant_price_index local_purchasing_power_index 
#>                     4.863177                     2.187319 
#>                  development 
#>                     2.241055
\end{verbatim}

Since according to this method none of the values is \textgreater10 the theory of multicollinearity is therefore rejected.

Now that all assumptions can be accepted, the evaluation of the model follows.

The model makes a significant explanatory contribution, as the p-value is well below 0.05, and we can proceed with the interpretation of the further results.

As indicated by the p-values, all variables except development classification have a significant impact on the cost of living index.

\section{Critical assessment of the data}\label{critical-assessment}}

The objective of this study was to determine if the status as an industrialized or developing country has an influence on the Cost of Living Index.

The critical review allows first of all to scrutinize the available data. Most of the data sets that were used as a basis for this work did not include all existing countries. In addition, it must be mentioned that a large number of African countries in particular are not included in the initial data. This could have biased the results of the work (see figure \ref{fig:worldMap}).

Furthermore, data were added that resulted in additional analysis possibilities, such as the representation of industrialized and developing countries. Data from the United Nations is considered to be trusted because the United Nations is an official and recognized organization.

Data produced by third parties are classified as less trustworthy, as this can lead to falsification. Since this was based on the regional allocation of the data provided for the different countries, the usage does not have a high weighting in the result.

\hypertarget{expressiveness-of-the-model-used}{%
\section{Expressiveness of the model used}\label{expressiveness-of-the-model-used}}

Furthermore, it must be critically questioned whether the multiple linear regression model used was really suitable to be applied to the research question. A multiple linear regression model was used with all numerical variables within the data set to determine which variables have a significant influence on the cli. Alternatively, the model could have been set up with only the variable developed and one other variable such as the rent index. However, we decided to use all variables in order to obtain the highest possible R². A simple linear regression between the cli and the developed variable was not possible because the linear relationship does not exist. In order to answer the research question more comprehensively, an additional t-test could have been implemented. However, we decided against this, as it would have exceeded the scope of our work.

\hypertarget{answer-to-the-research-question}{%
\section{Answer to the research question}\label{answer-to-the-research-question}}

Within the report, we conclude that the classification of a country as a developing or industrialized country does not have a significant impact on cli (see chapter \ref{results}). This is true for our data set. However, some countries are missing from our data set, so we cannot make this statement universally (see chapter \ref{critical-assessment}).
